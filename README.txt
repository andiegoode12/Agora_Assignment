README

Below or some notes about my thought process and the files included.

- You will see there are 3 extra files in this folder, including this one.
  I did the assignment as I normally would, creating the webpage, applying css
  and adding javascript. However, once I completed the css, I thought it would 
  be a good idea to try rewriting it using flexbox. There are two completed webpages
  which use the same .js file, one webpage (agora_flex.html) uses flexbox for 
  styling and the other (agora_page.html) does not. Though I am unfamiliar with
  flex, it made the webpage look much cleaner. The only issue that I had was with
  images not resizing with the page.

- For the countdown, I was not sure what date I was supposed to be counting down
  to. I went with October 5, 5 days from when you will see this on Monday, Sept 30.
